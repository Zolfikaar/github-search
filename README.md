## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I need to keep testing this bonus task (`prefers-color-scheme` in CSS), and check how i can use it without conflicting it's behavior with my custom theme script, in general i didn't like the way its work, i prefer javascript approach if that possible.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript Date Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) - This helped me for dealing/changing between different date format.
- [CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - This amazing tool helped me generating the desired grid layout. I'd recommend it to anyone who know the concept.
